Unfortunately, when I went back about a month later on April 21, it was no longer on the dinner menu.  Using the Wayback Machine, can you help me figure out which main course was on the dinner menu for Virtue on March 22, 2021 but not April 21, 2021? Answer using the singular form, without articles.",
