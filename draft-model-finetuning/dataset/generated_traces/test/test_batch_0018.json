For the easternmost city, I need to examine the birthplaces on the East Coast, particularly in New England. Several early presidents were born in Massachusetts. John Adams and John Quincy Adams were born in Braintree, Massachusetts. A quick check confirms that Braintree, Massachusetts is one of the easternmost birth cities. Therefore, the two cities at the extremes are Honolulu and Braintree.",
