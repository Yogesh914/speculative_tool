In this system, the numbers represent the count of leading wheels, driving wheels, and trailing wheels, respectively. To get the total number of wheels for a single locomotive, I need to sum these numbers. For example, a 4-6-2 locomotive has 4 + 6 + 2 = 12 wheels. Now I can process the file to calculate the total for all steam locomotives. I will use the code interpreter to read the Excel file, filter for rows where the 'Type' is 'Steam', parse the 'Wheel Configuration' for each, sum the numbers to get the wheels per locomotive, and then sum these totals to get the final answer.",
