The description of the artwork on the Whitney Museum's website mentions that the subject is holding a copy of Carl von Clausewitz's \"On War\".

        "thought": "The search results indicate that after being captured by the French and later released, Carl von Clausewitz refused to serve in the French-allied Prussian army. Instead, he joined the Imperial Russian Army. Specifically, in 1813, he helped form and served as a staff officer in the Russian-German Legion. The question asks for the military unit and to answer without articles. Therefore, the answer is 'Russian-German Legion'.",
