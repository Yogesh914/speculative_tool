Can Earl walk through every plot he owns (and no other plots) and return to his starting plot without backtracking? For this question, consider backtracking to be any instance where Earl would enter a plot of land he had already entered since leaving his starting plot.",

A path that visits every cell once and returns to the start is only possible if the cells form a single, continuous loop. I will check for any 'dead ends' (a green cell with only one green neighbor) or branching points that would make such a loop impossible.\n\nThe green cells are located at:\nB2, C2, D2\nB3\nB4, C4, D4, E4\nD5\nB6, C6, D6\n\nLet's analyze the neighbors for some of these cells:\n- The cell D2 is green, and its only adjacent green cell is C2. This is a dead end.\n- The cell E4 is green, and its only adjacent green cell is D4. This is another dead end.\n- The cell D5 is green, and its only adjacent green cell is D4. This is a third dead end.\n- The cell B6 is green, and its only adjacent green cell is C6. This is a fourth dead end.\n\nIf Earl were to enter any of these dead-end cells (like D2 from C2), he would have to immediately exit back to the cell he came from (C2) to continue to other plots. This action of re-entering C2 constitutes backtracking as defined in the problem. Since there are multiple dead ends, it is impossible to traverse all green plots without backtracking and return to the start.",
