To print a sequence of characters, one typically chains applications of the `.` operator. For example, to print \"Hi\", the code would be ``.H`.i`i`. The `r` function is a built-in function that prints a newline and then behaves like the identity function `i`. Therefore, to print a string of N characters, there must be N applications, which means there must be N backticks. I will now count the number of characters to be printed and the number of backticks in the given code.",
