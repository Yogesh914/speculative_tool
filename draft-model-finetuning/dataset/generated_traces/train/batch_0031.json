A likely intermediate page would be one about the genre that both books share. Both are seminal works of high fantasy. I will check if the \"The Lord of the Rings\" page links to the \"High fantasy\" page. It does.

Click the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" link on the \"High fantasy\" page.\nSince a one-click path does not exist, the minimum number of clicks is 2.",
