There are 6 cubes with one colored face, 12 edge cubes with two colored faces, and 8 corner cubes with three colored faces. All blue cubes have been found. All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found, along with the center cube. The green corners have all been found, along with all green that borders yellow. For all orange cubes found, the opposite face\u2019s cubes have been found. The removed cube has two colors on its faces. What are they? Answer using a comma separated list, with the colors ordered alphabetically.",

First, I need to establish the set of all possible two-colored (edge) cubes on a standard Rubik's cube. A standard cube has opposite color pairs: White/Yellow, Blue/Green, and Red/Orange. There are 12 edge cubes in total.",

'All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found'. These are the four edge pieces that share a side with the orange center. On a standard cube, these would be Orange/White, Orange/Yellow, Orange/Green, and Orange/Blue.\n3.  '...all green that borders yellow.' This refers to the Green/Yellow edge cube.\n4.  'For all orange cubes found, the opposite face\u2019s cubes have been found.' The face opposite orange is red. From clue 2, we know the orange edge cubes (Orange/White, Orange/Yellow, Orange/Green, Orange/Blue) were found. Therefore, their opposite counterparts on the red face must also be found. The opposite of Orange/White is Red/White. The opposite of Orange/Yellow is Red/Yellow. The opposite of Orange/Green is Red/Green. The opposite of Orange/Blue is Red/Blue.\n\nI will compile a list of all found cubes and remove them from the initial list.",
