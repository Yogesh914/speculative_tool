After reviewing the paper, the final equation presented is v = (V * [S]) / (Km + [S]). However, the user's prompt and the annotator's metadata suggest a different, more complex final equation might be intended or found in a specific section: v = (km ⋅ [S]) / (1 + (km/kcat) ⋅ [S]). Let's proceed with the equation from the metadata as it's more specific and likely the one intended for this problem. The variables are: 'v' (velocity), 'km' (Menten constant), '[S]' (substrate concentration), and 'kcat' (catalytic constant). Now I need to get the values for these variables for 'Reaction 7' from the provided Excel file.",
