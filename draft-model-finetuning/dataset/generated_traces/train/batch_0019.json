After reviewing the history, I found a revision from 19 February 2009 with the comment 'added {{Thomas Aquinas}} template'. This is a strong candidate for the first addition of the picture. I have checked the revisions before this date and confirmed that no picture of St. Thomas Aquinas was present. Therefore, the date the picture was first added is 19 February 2009. I now need to format this date as DD/MM/YYYY.",
