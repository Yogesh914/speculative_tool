A statement of the form P ↔ Q is a tautology if P and Q are logically equivalent.\n\n1.  `¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B)`: This is De Morgan's Law, which is a tautology.\n2.  `¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B)`: This is the other De Morgan's Law, also a tautology.\n3.  `(A → B) ↔ (¬B → ¬A)`: This is the law of contraposition, which is a tautology.\n4.  `(A → B) ↔ (¬A ∨ B)`: This is the material implication equivalence, a tautology.\n5.  `(¬A → B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)`: Let's analyze this. The left side, `(¬A → B)`, is equivalent to `¬(¬A) ∨ B`, which simplifies to `A ∨ B`. So the statement is `(A ∨ B) ↔ (A ∨ ¬B)`. Let's test this. If A is False and B is True, the left side `(F ∨ T)` is True. The right side `(F ∨ F)` is False. Since True ↔ False is False, this statement is not a tautology.\n6.  `¬(A → B) ↔ (A ∧ ¬B)`: This is the negation of a conditional. `¬(A → B)` is equivalent to `¬(¬A ∨ B)`, which by De Morgan's law is `¬(¬A) ∧ ¬B`, which simplifies to `A ∧ ¬B`. This is a tautology.\n\nTherefore, the fifth statement is the one that is not a tautology, while all others are. The question asks for the statement that is not logically equivalent to the rest, which means the one that is not a tautology.",
