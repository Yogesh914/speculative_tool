Now that I have located the graph, I need to understand how it is visualized. Specifically, I need to determine what metric the size of the bubbles represents. On the Connected Papers platform, the size of the nodes (bubbles) is a visual representation of the number of citations a paper has. Therefore, the largest bubble corresponds to the paper with the most citations.",
