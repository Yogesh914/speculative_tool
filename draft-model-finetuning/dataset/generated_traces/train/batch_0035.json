    "question": "I read a paper about multiwavelength observations of fast radio bursts back in March 2021 on Arxiv, and it had a fascinating diagram of an X-ray time profile. There was a similar burst-1 diagram in another paper from one of the same authors about fast radio bursts back in July 2020, but I can't recall what the difference in seconds in the measured time span was. How many more seconds did one measure than the other? Just give the number.",
