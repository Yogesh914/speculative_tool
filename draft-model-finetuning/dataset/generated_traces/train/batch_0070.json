        "thought": "To answer this question, I need to calculate the volume of a gas given its mass, pressure, and temperature. The ideal gas law, PV = nRT, is the appropriate formula. I need to find the values for pressure (P), number of moles (n), the ideal gas constant (R), and temperature (T). I will rearrange the formula to solve for volume: V = nRT/P.\n\nFirst, I'll find the number of moles (n). I'm given the mass (0.312 kg), so I need the molar mass of Freon-12.",
