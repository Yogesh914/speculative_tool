I will examine the revision history around these dates. I'll start by looking for revisions on February 29, 2004. I see a revision by user 'Dbiv' at 23:51 on 29 February 2004 with the comment \"(revert humor)\". This looks promising. I need to compare this revision with the one immediately preceding it to see what was removed. The previous revision was by user '138.163.0.41' at 23:49 on 29 February 2004. I will get the content of the page from the revision made by '138.163.0.41'.",
