I need to identify South Station and Windsor Gardens in the list and then count the number of stations between them. The typical order of stops is: South Station, Back Bay, Ruggles, Forest Hills, Roslindale Village, Bellevue, Highland, West Roxbury, Islington, Norwood Depot, Norwood Central, Windsor Gardens, and so on. Let me list and count the stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens:\n1. Back Bay\n2. Ruggles\n3. Forest Hills\n4. Roslindale Village\n5. Bellevue\n6. Highland\n7. West Roxbury\n8. Islington\n9. Norwood Depot\n10. Norwood Central\nThis gives a total of 10 stops. The question specifies the date \"May 2023\", so I should do a quick check to ensure no stations were added or removed on this part of the line before that date which would alter the count.",

        "thought": "The search results for service changes in 2023 do not indicate any permanent station additions or closures between South Station and Windsor Gardens on the Franklin Line. The changes mentioned are typically related to schedules or temporary maintenance. Therefore, the count of 10 stops is accurate for May 2023. I can now provide the final answer.",
