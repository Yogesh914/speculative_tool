I need to use the Biopython library in Python to accomplish this. First, I will write a Python script to parse the PDB file, get the first two atoms, and calculate the distance between them. The distance between two atom objects in Biopython can be found by subtracting one from the other.",

Since 1 Angstrom = 100 picometers, rounding to the nearest picometer is equivalent to rounding the value in Angstroms to three decimal places. I will use Python to perform this rounding.",
