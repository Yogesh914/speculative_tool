The question he asked us was about an anagram. I've attached an audio recording of the question that he asked, so if you could please take a listen and give me the answer, I'd really appreciate the help. Please limit your response to the anagram text that could be generated from the original line which fulfills the professor's request, without any other commentary. Also, please don't include any punctuation in your response.",

I need to find the original famous line from Shakespeare's Hamlet that is an anagram of this phrase. I will use a web search to find the solution to this anagram.",
