I need to carefully track the species present on screen throughout the video to find the moment with the highest diversity.\n- The video starts with a Northern Cardinal.\n- A Blue Jay arrives, making it two species.\n- A Downy Woodpecker joins them, bringing the count to three species (Cardinal, Blue Jay, Woodpecker).\n- Later, other combinations of birds are seen, but the number of distinct species on camera at any single moment does not exceed three. For example, at one point a Chickadee, a Blue Jay, and a Woodpecker are visible together. Therefore, the highest number of bird species on camera simultaneously is 3.",
