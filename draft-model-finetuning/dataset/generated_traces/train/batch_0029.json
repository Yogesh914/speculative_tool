The question is to count the number of books by a specific author ('Rick Riordan') that are not currently on the library's shelves. 'Not on the shelves' likely corresponds to statuses like 'Checked Out' or 'Overdue'.\n\nMy plan is:\n1.  Read the content of the PDF file to understand its structure and data.\n2.  Analyze the data, likely by filtering it based on the author and status.\n3.  Count the results of the filtered data.\n\nI will start by using the `file_reader` tool to access the PDF's content.",
