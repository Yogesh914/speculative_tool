    "question": "I'm making a grocery list for my mom, but she's a professor of botany and she's a real stickler when it comes to categorizing things. I need to add different foods to different categories on the grocery list, but if I make a mistake, she won't buy anything inserted in the wrong category. Here's the list I have so far:\n\nmilk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts\n\nI need to make headings for the fruits and vegetables. Could you please create a list of just the vegetables from my list? If you could do that, then I can figure out how to categorize the rest of the list into the appropriate categories. But remember that my mom is a real stickler, so make sure that no botanical fruits end up on the vegetable list, or she won't get them when she's at the store. Please alphabetize the list of vegetables, and place each item in a comma separated list.",

A botanical vegetable is any edible part of a plant that is not a fruit (the mature ovary of a flowering plant). I need to go through the list, filter out non-plant items, and then classify the remaining plant-based items as either a botanical fruit or a vegetable. Finally, I will compile the list of vegetables, alphabetize it, and present it as a comma-separated list.\n\nThe initial list is: milk, eggs, flour, whole bean coffee, Oreos, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts.\n\nFirst, I'll filter out items that are not whole plant parts: milk, eggs, flour, Oreos.\n\nThe list to classify is: whole bean coffee, sweet potatoes, fresh basil, plums, green beans, rice, corn, bell pepper, whole allspice, acorns, broccoli, celery, zucchini, lettuce, peanuts.\n\nI will use a search tool to find the botanical classification for each of these items to ensure accuracy.",

This is a **vegetable**.\n- `fresh basil`: These are leaves. This is a **vegetable**.\n- `plums`: This is a fruit containing a seed. This is a botanical fruit.\n- `green beans`: The pod is the fruit of the plant, containing seeds. This is a botanical fruit.\n- `rice`: This is a grain, which is a type of fruit (a caryopsis). This is a botanical fruit.\n- `corn`: A kernel of corn is a type of fruit (a caryopsis). This is a botanical fruit.\n- `bell pepper`: This develops from the flower's ovary and contains seeds. This is a botanical fruit.\n- `whole allspice`: These are dried, unripe fruits (berries). This is a botanical fruit.\n- `acorns`: This is the nut (fruit) of the oak tree. This is a botanical fruit.\n- `broccoli`: These are flower buds. This is a **vegetable**.\n- `celery`: This is a leaf stalk (petiole). This is a **vegetable**.\n- `zucchini`: This is a type of squash, which is the mature ovary of the plant. This is a botanical fruit.\n- `lettuce`: These are leaves. This is a **vegetable**.\n- `peanuts`: These are legumes, and the part we eat is the seed inside the fruit (the pod). This is a botanical fruit.\n- `whole bean coffee`: This is the seed of the coffee cherry (a fruit).
