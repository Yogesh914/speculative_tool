The derivative of x^2 is 2x, so the derivative of 2 * x^2 is 2 * 2x = 4x.\n\nThe equation becomes: 11x = 4x + 4097 - 150.\n\nNow I need to solve for x. I will use the calculator to simplify and solve the equation.\n11x = 4x + (4097 - 150)\n11x = 4x + 3947\n11x - 4x = 3947\n7x = 3947\nx = 3947 / 7",
