It gives each locomotive\u2019s identifying number, operating status, and the name of the daily excursion it heads, if operational. What are the odds that today\u2019s Sunset Picnic Trip will use a steam locomotive? Assume that each day\u2019s excursion picks one of its assigned locomotives at random, and express the answer in the form \u201c1 in 4\u201d, \u201c1 in 5\u201d, etc.",

To do this, I need to find out two things from the provided Excel file: 1) the total number of locomotives assigned to the 'Sunset Picnic Trip', and 2) how many of those are steam locomotives. I will start by reading the file.",
