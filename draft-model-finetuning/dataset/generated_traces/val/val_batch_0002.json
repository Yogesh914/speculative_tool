    "question": "The year is 2022. I am at the National Air and Space Museum east of the Potomac River. I want to go to Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF using the metro. I go in the wrong direction and end up at the station closest to Cleveland Elementary School. How many metro stations am I away from my original destination if I don't change lines? Your answer should be a numerical integer value.",

      {
        "thought": "First, I need to identify the correct National Air and Space Museum. The question specifies it's east of the Potomac River, which implies there might be more than one location. I'll search for the museum's locations and then check a map to see which is east of the river.",

        "thought": "The search results indicate two main locations: one on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., and the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia. Washington D.C. is east of the Potomac River, while Chantilly is west. So, the starting point is the museum in D.C. Now I need to find the closest metro station to that museum.",

        "thought": "The closest metro station to the National Air and Space Museum in D.C. is L'Enfant Plaza. Next, I need to find the metro station for the intended destination, \"Fire Station 301 DCA ARFF\". The \"DCA\" in the name suggests it's at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.",

        "thought": "The search confirms that Fire Station 301 is at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), and the corresponding metro station is the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station. This is my intended destination station. Now, I need to find the station I ended up at, which is the one closest to \"Cleveland Elementary School\". I'll assume the school is in the D.C. area.",

So, my current location is Shaw-Howard Univ, and my intended destination is Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The problem states I must travel between these two without changing lines. I need to find a D.C. metro map from 2022 to identify the common line and count the stops.",

Shaw-Howard Univ is on the Green and Yellow lines. Ronald Reagan Airport is on the Blue and Yellow lines. The common line is the Yellow Line. Now I will count the number of stations between Shaw-Howard Univ and Ronald Reagan Airport on the Yellow Line, not including the starting station. The stations are: Mt Vernon Sq, Gallery Pl-Chinatown, Archives, L'Enfant Plaza, Pentagon, Pentagon City, Crystal City, and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The total count is 8.",
