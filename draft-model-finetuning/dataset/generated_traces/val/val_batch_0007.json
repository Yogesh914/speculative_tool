I remove one cup of honey at a time from the gallon of honey. How many times will I need to remove a cup to have the honey weigh less than the mayonaise? Assume the containers themselves weigh the same.",

With this information, I can calculate the initial weights of the honey and mayonnaise and the weight of one cup of honey. Finally, I can set up an inequality to determine how many cups of honey (N) must be removed for the remaining honey to weigh less than the mayonnaise.",
