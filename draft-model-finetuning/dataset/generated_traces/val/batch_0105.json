I need to decipher the two groups of symbols provided in the question: <y_bin_365> and <y_bin_115>.\n- The first symbol, <y_bin_365>, represents the number 8.\n- The second group of symbols, <y_bin_115>, represents the number 56 (five '10' wedges and six '1' wedges).\nSo, the Babylonian number is represented as two groups: 8 and 56. In a base-60 system, this is interpreted as (8 * 60^1) + (56 * 60^0). I will now use a calculator to compute the final decimal value.",
