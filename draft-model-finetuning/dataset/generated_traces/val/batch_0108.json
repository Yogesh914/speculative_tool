After reviewing the papers, I've identified \"Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation\" as the correct one. By inspecting the paper's content, specifically Figure 1, I can identify the six words used as labels on the axes. The labels are: deontological, consequential, utilitarian, egalitarian, standardized, and localized. Now I need to find a Physics and Society article from August 11, 2016, and check if it uses any of these words.",

One of the results is titled \"Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints\". This title contains the word \"egalitarian\", which was one of the words from the figure in the first paper. Therefore, this is the answer.",
