The instructions themselves are contradictory and thus don't make sense, which suggests I should write \"Pineapple\".\n2. The second instruction is to not answer the numbered questions.\n3. The third instruction is to write *only* the word \"Guava\".\n\nThe third instruction is a direct and absolute command (\"Write only the word 'Guava'\"), while the first is conditional. In cases of conflicting instructions, the most direct and final command usually takes precedence. Therefore, I will follow the third instruction and ignore the others. I will not answer the questions and I will not write \"Pineapple\". The final answer is \"Guava\".",
