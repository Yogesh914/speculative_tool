A statement of the form P \u2194 Q is a tautology if P and Q are logically equivalent.\n\n1.  `\u00ac(A \u2227 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2228 \u00acB)`: This is De Morgan's Law, which is a tautology.\n2.  `\u00ac(A \u2228 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB)`: This is the other De Morgan's Law, also a tautology.\n3.  `(A \u2192 B) \u2194 (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA)`: This is the law of contraposition, which is a tautology.\n4.  `(A \u2192 B) \u2194 (\u00acA \u2228 B)`: This is the material implication equivalence, a tautology.\n5.  `(\u00acA \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB)`: Let's analyze this. The left side, `(\u00acA \u2192 B)`, is equivalent to `\u00ac(\u00acA) \u2228 B`, which simplifies to `A \u2228 B`. So the statement is `(A \u2228 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB)`. Let's test this. If A is False and B is True, the left side `(F \u2228 T)` is True. The right side `(F \u2228 F)` is False. Since True \u2194 False is False, this statement is not a tautology.\n6.  `\u00ac(A \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2227 \u00acB)`: This is the negation of a conditional. `\u00ac(A \u2192 B)` is equivalent to `\u00ac(\u00acA \u2228 B)`, which by De Morgan's law is `\u00ac(\u00acA) \u2227 \u00acB`, which simplifies to `A \u2227 \u00acB`. This is a tautology.\n\nTherefore, the fifth statement is the one that is not a tautology, while all others are. The question asks for the statement that is not logically equivalent to the rest, which means the one that is not a tautology.</thought>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<action>{\"tool_name\": \"final_answer\", \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"(\\u00acA \\u2192 B) \\u2194 (A \\u2228 \\u00acB)\"}}</action>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<final_answer>(\u00acA \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB)</final_answer>"}]}
